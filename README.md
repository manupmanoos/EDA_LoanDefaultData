# EDA_LoanDefaultData

##Background:
Lending club is the largest peer-to-peer marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders. Borrowers apply through an online platform where they are assigned an internal score. Lenders decide 1) whether to lend and 2) the terms of loan such as interest rate, monthly instalment, tenure etc.
Some popular products are credit card loans, debt consolidation loans, house loans, car loans etc.

##Business Objective:
To identify variables which are strong indicators of default and potentially use the insights in approval / rejection decision making.
